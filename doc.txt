spark.serializer org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer

Spark supports different serialization mechanisms; the choice is a trade-off between speed, space efficiency, and full support of all Java objects.
If you are using a serializer to cache your RDDs, you should strongly consider a fast serializer.
The default serializer uses Java's default serialization.
The KyroSerializer is much faster and generally uses about one-tenth of the memory as the default serializer.
You can switch the serializer by changing spark.serializer to spark.KryoSerializer.
If you want to use the KyroSerializer, you need to make sure that the classes are serializable by the KyroSerializer.
